                        <h2>My Role at PLUS<>
                            <p>As a tutor at PLUS, I immersed myself in the handbook, which equips educators with strategies for engaging children and fostering enthusiasm for mathematics. My focus was on making calculus problems fun and relatable. For instance, when teaching division and fractions, I used the example of sharing a pizza, where the number of pizzas represented the numerator and the slices were the denominator, helping students understand fractions in a tangible way. Additionally, I shared simple tricks for converting decimals to fractions, such as counting the digits after the decimal point, removing the decimal, placing a 1 in the denominator, and adding zeros accordingly. This approach not only made learning enjoyable but also helped build their mental math skills.</p>
