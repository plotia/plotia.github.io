                        <h2>Abstract :</h2>
                        <p>
                            This initiative was dedicated to the final project for the course "Computational Methods for Biological Modelling and Simulation". Cancer progression is influenced by genetic mutations, selective pressures, and environmental factors. This project explores the stochastic Moran model to simulate cancer evolution, focusing on stage-specific probabilities, mutation dynamics, and immune responses. The study demonstrates how cancer cells proliferate under varying conditions and emphasizes early therapeutic interventions to control tumor growth.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Introduction :</h2>
                                  <p>Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and genetic mutations. Traditional deterministic models often fail to capture the randomness of tumor progression, making stochastic models, like the Moran model, essential tools for understanding tumor behavior and designing treatments. This project simulates cancer evolution to provide actionable insights for therapeutic strategies.
                            </p>
                        <h2>Key Objectives :</h2>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Develop a robust simulation framework for cancer dynamics using the Moran model.</li>
                                <li>Analyze the interplay between healthy, cancerous, and immune cells.</li>
                                <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.</li>
                                </ul>
                         <h2>Methodology:</h2>
                         <p>The Moran model simulates the competition between healthy and cancer cells. By incorporating parameters such as fitness, mutation probabilities, and immune responses, the model captures the randomness of cancer progression. Simulations were conducted on grid and graph-based frameworks, offering complementary perspectives.
                         </p>

                        <h3>Grid Approach :</h3>
                        <p>Cancer progression follows distinct patterns, from early-stage proliferation to advanced stages where immune cells dominate. Early interventions with high-dose therapies significantly delayed cancer growth.</p>
                        <h3>Graph Approach :</h3>
                        <p>Cancer cells rapidly overtook healthy cells without treatment. Alternative treatments targeting proliferating cells effectively controlled tumor spread.</p>
                        <h3>Key Findings :</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Early high-dose treatments outperform low-dose strategies.</li>
                            <li>Adaptive dosing slows resistance emergence.</li>
                            <li>Immune responses are critical but limited in advanced stages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            The stochastic Moran model highlights the importance of timing and adaptability in cancer treatment. Immune thresholds and stage-specific probabilities provide a realistic simulation of tumor behavior, emphasizing the need for early detection and targeted interventions.
