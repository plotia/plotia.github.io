                        <p>
                            This course is taught by Dr. Joshua Kangas, a dedicated educator and researcher with expertise in Automated Biology and Cloud Labs. His passion for teaching creates an engaging environment where students can truly thrive.
                            <br><br>
                            As a Teaching Assistant for the course "Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology," I am responsible for a range of supportive and instructional tasks. I assist Dr. Kangas during lectures and lab sessions, facilitating discussions and guiding students as they navigate the complexities of biological experimentation. This includes helping them design and execute experiments while ensuring they understand the principles of quantitative analysis and the importance of proper controls.
                            <br><br>
                            I also prepare laboratory materials, maintain equipment, and ensure a safe and effective lab environment. Mentoring students in their experimental designs is a key part of my role, as I provide feedback on their approaches and analyses and assist with interpreting results. Additionally, I help with grading assignments and lab reports and offer support during office hours. By fostering a collaborative and inquisitive atmosphere, I aim to help students gain critical skills in scientific research, enhancing their understanding of quantitative methodologies in biology.
