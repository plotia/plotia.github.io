                         <h1>Future Goals: A Vision for Revolutionizing Drug Discovery and Molecular Dynamics</h1>

<p>Since my earliest exposure to science, the mystery of atomic structures and their relationship to the diversity of life has captivated me. This deep curiosity led me to pursue a B.Tech in Pharmaceuticals Chemistry and Technology at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bombay, India. Initially, I struggled with biology due to the rote learning system prevalent in Indian education. However, my mother’s encouragement to question everything opened my mind to the conceptual depth behind each theory. I soon realized that the field of pharmaceuticals needed not just small molecules but also alternatives like larger biomolecules, such as aptamers, PROTACs, and antibodies. It was during my undergraduate experience, particularly through brief exposure to molecular docking, that I came to understand the transformative potential of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD).
<br><br>
This realization sparked my pursuit of a master’s in Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Here, I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning and deep learning models that will contribute to more efficient and accurate drug discovery processes. I believe that the future of pharmaceutical science lies in building computational models that can represent the human body down to the atomic level. This ultimate goal drives every aspect of my academic and research endeavors.
</p>
<h2>Research Focus and Development of Force Fields</h2>

<p>In my current research, I have been focusing on the E104D mutation of the Triose Phosphate Isomerase enzyme. My hypothesis is that the glutamic acid, lysine, and asparagine cascade found in the wild-type enzyme cannot be replicated in the E104D mutant, leading to a loss of structural integrity. To test this hypothesis, I am using molecular dynamics simulations and believe that polarizable force fields, such as the Amoeba software, hold the key to understanding these molecular interactions more accurately.
<br><br>
However, the current version of Amoeba presents several challenges, such as its high computational demands and a lack of user-friendly interfaces, making it difficult for beginners like me to fully explore its potential without extensive guidance. Therefore, one of my major long-term goals is to develop a more efficient and accessible polarizable force field. I plan to leverage quantum and medicinal chemistry techniques to create a faster, more intuitive model that is compatible with a wide range of software tools. This endeavor is not just a technical challenge—it is a step toward empowering the next generation of researchers to conduct more advanced molecular simulations with ease.
</p>
<h2>Long-Term Vision: Doctoral Research and Industry Contributions</h2>

<p>After completing my master’s program, I intend to devote the next five years to pursuing a Ph.D., where I will focus on drug discovery and force field development. My goal is to work in a lab that is actively advancing force-field-based algorithms. By collaborating with leading experts in the field, I aim to contribute to the development of a new algorithm that is faster, more adaptable, and accessible to a broader range of researchers.
<br><br>
Following my Ph.D., I hope to join NVIDIA’s Biology team, where cutting-edge computing technologies are used to optimize drug discovery processes. With sufficient experience and financial backing, I plan to start my own company focused on creating highly detailed simulations of human organs, down to every biological atom. By offering a platform for visualizing complex biological systems, I aim to address some of the most challenging questions in healthcare, such as how to effectively diagnose and treat organ disorders.
</p>
<h2>Industrial Applications and Societal Impact</h2>

<p>If my path leads me to a different route than NVIDIA, I am equally excited to collaborate with pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer, Merck, and Moderna. In these roles, I would focus on designing larger therapeutic molecules, such as proteins that are more substantial than antibodies. My aim is to help create therapies with fewer side effects and greater efficacy, ultimately improving the quality and longevity of human life.
<br><br>
Looking further ahead, I envision a world where every young scientist can answer their questions about biology and medicine through detailed, visualized models. By providing tools that allow researchers to imagine new therapies and simulate their effects, I believe we can revolutionize how drugs are developed and tested. The ability to model complex biological systems with unprecedented accuracy will open new avenues for innovation and therapeutic discovery.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In summary, my future goals are centered around pushing the boundaries of drug discovery through advanced molecular dynamics simulations. By developing more accessible and efficient computational tools, I aim to make meaningful contributions both in academia and industry. Ultimately, I am driven by the desire to see my work translate into tangible benefits for society—whether it is through improving existing therapies, creating new diagnostic tools, or empowering future scientists with better resources. I am committed to making a lasting impact on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, one step at a time.
