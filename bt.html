                        <h2>About The Bombay Technologist</h2>
                        <p>
                           The Bombay Technologist is the in-house peer reviewed research Journal of the Institute of Chemical Technology published semi-annually.

It was started in 1951, by the erstwhile Technological Association, the highest decision making student body of the institute.Professor K. Venkatraman, a pioneer in Chemical Technology himself, envisioned the concept of an in-house research journal run by the institute and thus laid the foundation of Bombay Technologist.
The Institute of Chemical Technology is itself an internationally renowned center for research. It churns out hundreds of quality research publications and numerous patents every year solely in Chemical Engineering and Technology. Such a distinction is enjoyed by few, globally.
