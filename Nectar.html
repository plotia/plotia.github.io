              <p>Nectar Lifesciences is a prominent pharmaceutical company based in India, specializing in the manufacturing and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), formulations, and phytochemicals.

                At Nectar Lifesciences, it was my first step into the corporate world. It was out here, I came to know about how large scale manufacturing of pharmaceutical APIs work. It was a great experience to know the packaging of Cephalosporins through milling seiving and sifting.
